# Software-Health-Monitoring
 This project involves a daemon-server system monitoring application heartbeats, reacting to issues like missed heartbeats by restarting the application. It includes robust error handling and features like multithreading for enhanced flexibility.
Detailed explanation
Project Overview:
This project involves a daemon-server and client-application communication system over TCP/IP sockets.
Functionality:
The daemon monitors application heartbeats, ensuring their proper functioning, and takes corrective actions upon missed heartbeats, such as restarting the application.
Communication Protocol:
Communication between the daemon and application follows a protocol where the application registers upon connection, sends regular heartbeats, and can issue commands to the daemon.
Heartbeat Mechanism:
Heartbeats serve as indicators of application liveliness, with the daemon tracking their receipt and responding accordingly.
Error Handling and Logging:
Robust error handling and logging mechanisms are implemented to handle socket communication errors, file I/O issues, and system call failures.
Additional Features:
Multithreading may be employed for concurrent client connections, while features like command-line arguments and signal handling enhance configurability and graceful shutdown.
